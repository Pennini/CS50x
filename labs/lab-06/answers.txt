Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: All the predictions proved incorrect

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: After the 100000 simulations, because, after that, the time spent in the simulations increased by almost 7 times
